# gta_autonomous_driving

Made a bot that can autonomously drive in GTA V. Used a modified version of AlexNet (a groundbreaking deep convolutional
neural network: https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2012/file/c399862d3b9d6b76c8436e924a68c45b-Paper.pdf) to train the bot.

Cool graphs, but to be honest, my hyperparameters were chosen by pure instinct and multiple trials. I'm still new to deep learning. 

## lane detection

Used Hough Transform for lane detection (https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1757-899X/297/1/012050)

## object detection

I added some object detection for fun.
